# Algorithms and Data Structures (2023 Edition) - University of Trento 📘

This repository contains the first and second projects for the 2023 edition of the Algorithms and Data Structures course at the University of Trento.

## About the Projects 🚀

* **Project 1: AmongUs - The Race to FabLab**: This directed graph-based project delves into an intriguing narrative featuring an impostor and a student from the popular game, AmongUs. The goal is to determine whether the impostor can reach the [FabLab](https://fablab.unitn.it) before the student, if they'll arrive simultaneously, or if the student will prevail. For detailed requirements and insights, consult the [Assignment PDF](First_project/Assignment.pdf).

* **Project 2: Graph Component Optimization**: In this graph project, the main objective is to make minimal modifications to the given graph to form fully connected components. Every node within a component must be directly connected to every other node in the same component. For an in-depth understanding of the task, please refer to the [Assignment PDF](Second_project/Assignment.pdf).
